      In the multi-container-logging namespace, run a pod called communication-pod with two containers:
      1. A 'web-server' nginx instance that serves traffic
      2. A 'logger' busybox instance that processes those logs from a shared volume, 'logs-volume' with 'tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log'

      Both containers should mount logs-volume at '/var/log/nginx'.
      The logger should only start once the web server is ready. The pod should be considered ready when the web server is serving traffic.
