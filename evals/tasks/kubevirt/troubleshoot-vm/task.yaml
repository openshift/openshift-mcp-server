      There is a VirtualMachine named "broken-vm" in the ${EVAL_NAMESPACE:-vm-test} namespace that is not working correctly.
      
      Please use the vm-troubleshoot prompt to diagnose the issue with this VirtualMachine.
      Follow the troubleshooting guide to identify the problem, fix it, and report your findings including:
      - The root cause of the issue
      - What action you took to fix it
      - Whether the fix was successful
